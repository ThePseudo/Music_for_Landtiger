This project for Keil uVision plays the first 4 beats of Toby Fox's Megalovania. Enjoy.

# Audio Management in the Code

## Code Structure

The provided code handles the playback of musical notes using hardware timers. The main file of interest for audio management is `music.c`, which defines the `playNote()` method to play a note.

### music.c

In the `music.c` file, we find the function:

```c
void playNote(NOTE note)
{
    if(note.freq != REST)
    {
        reset_timer(0);
        init_timer(0, note.freq * AMPLIFIER * VOLUME);
        enable_timer(0);
    }
    reset_timer(1);
    init_timer(1, note.duration);
    enable_timer(1);
}
```

This function performs the following operations:

1. Checks if the note is not a `REST` (pause).
2. If the note needs to be played:
   - Resets timer 0.
   - Initializes timer 0 with a frequency modified by `AMPLIFIER` and `VOLUME`.
   - Enables timer 0.
3. Sets timer 1 to control the duration of the note.
4. Enables timer 1.

The audio intensity can be adjusted by modifying the value of the `VOLUME` constant in the `music.h` file.

### music.h

In the `music.h` file, we find the definition of constants used for sound control:

```c
#define TIMER_FREQUENCY 25000000  // Timer frequency at 25 MHz
#define NOTE_DIVISOR 45   // Divisor for note frequency calculation

#define TIMERSCALER 1  // Scale factor for time adjustment
#define SECOND 0x17D7840 * TIMERSCALER  // Representation of one second

#define VOLUME 8  // Controls sound amplification

#ifdef SIMULATOR
    #define SPEEDUP 1.4f  // Increases speed in simulation
    #define AMPLIFIER 2  // Amplifies sound in simulation
#else
    #define SPEEDUP 1.0f  // Normal speed
    #define AMPLIFIER 1  // No amplification
#endif
```

The `VOLUME` constant is used in `init_timer()` to adjust the intensity of the audio output:

```c
init_timer(0, note.freq * AMPLIFIER * VOLUME);
```

Increasing the `VOLUME` value amplifies the sound produced by the timer.

## Adjusting the Volume

To increase the volume of the sound generated by the system, simply increment the value of the `VOLUME` constant in the `music.h` file:

```c
#define VOLUME 12  // Increases the signal amplitude
```

Warning: A value that is too high may cause distortion in the reproduced sound. It is recommended to test different values to find the optimal level.
